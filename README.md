# UltimateUniverseSimulatorEngine
I spent most of my free time during the lockdown of spring 2020 thinking about a design for a universe simulator. It puts a big emphasis on elementary particules interaction. In fact, everything is a particule with a state and everything which happpens is a communication between particles.  
Implementing a simplified version of our universe should be quite easy with this design.  
Unfortunately I need too much time and brain power to actually implement this abstract idea (which I will probably find totally stupid when implemented)
